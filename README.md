## üéØ Detection Methods Explained

### 1. Keyword Competition Detection üèÜ
**How it works**: Analyzes GSC data to find URLs ranking for the same keywords

**Detects**:
- Pages splitting traffic for the same queries
- Ranking fluctuations due to Google confusion
- Actual SERP competition

**Best for**: Finding active cannibalization impacting traffic

### 2. Content Similarity Detection üìÑ
**How it works**: Compares page elements and content

**Detects**:
- Similar titles and headings
- Overlapping meta descriptions
- Content theme similarities

**Best for**: Finding potential future cannibalization

### 3. Combined Detection üîÑ
**How it works**: Uses both methods plus ML scoring

**Detects**:
- All types of cannibalization
- Provides confidence scores
- Reduces false positives

**Best for**: Comprehensive analysis

## üìä Understanding the Metrics

### Competition Score
- **0-30%**: Low risk - Monitor
- **30-50%**: Medium risk - Optimize
- **50-70%**: High risk - Take action
- **70-100%**: Critical - Immediate action needed

### Detection Sources
- **keyword_competition**: Found through GSC query analysis
- **content_similarity**: Found through content comparison
- **both**: Detected by multiple methods (high confidence)

### Key Metrics
- **Shared Queries Count**: Number of keywords both URLs rank for
- **Traffic Opportunity**: Estimated traffic gain from fixing
- **Confidence Score**: Likelihood of true cannibalization

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "No issues detected"
1. **Lower thresholds**:
   - Set Min Shared Keywords to 1
   - Set Min Similarity to 0.15
2. **Disable performance filtering**
3. **Check URL format consistency** between files
4. **Enable debug mode** to see filtering details

### "URL matching errors"
1. The new URL normalizer handles most cases automatically
2. Check debug mode output for normalization details
3. Ensure URLs are complete (include protocol)

### "Too many results"
1. Increase Min Shared Keywords to 3-5
2. Increase Min Similarity to 0.30
3. Enable performance filtering
4. Focus on Competition-First method

## üìà Best Practices

### For Maximum Detection
- Detection Method: Combined
- Min Shared Keywords: 1-2
- Min Similarity: 0.15-0.20
- Performance Filter: OFF
- Debug Mode: ON

### For Large Sites (1000+ URLs)
- Use Competition-First method
- Enable performance filtering
- Process high-traffic sections first
- Increase thresholds slightly

### For Actionable Results
- Focus on High/Critical risk issues
- Review AI recommendations
- Check traffic opportunity scores
- Validate with actual SERP analysis

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Detection Pipeline
Configure your own detection approach:
- Adjust individual method weights
- Set custom risk thresholds
- Enable/disable specific analyzers

### API Rate Limit Management
